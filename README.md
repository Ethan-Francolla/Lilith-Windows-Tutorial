## Install Lilith in the proper location
- You can download Lilith for windows [Here][lilithdownload] if you haven't already
- Go to your desktop and right click on an empty space and create a new folder called Lilith
- Drag and drop the executable file you just downloaded into that folder. 
-Note: Lilith WILL NOT work if it isn't in its own dedicated folder. Do not skip this step. Additionally, if you accidentally downloaded the Lilith executable more than once it may have something like a (1) at the end of the name that windows automatically gave it. If this is the case, please right click on the executable in your folder, select rename, and then remove the unwanted (1) from the end of it.
